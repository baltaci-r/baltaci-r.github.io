<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am a final year PhD student at <a href='https://publish.illinois.edu/varshney/'>University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign</a>, advised by <a href='https://www.varshney.csl.illinois.edu/'>Lav Varshney</a>. Prior to that I completed my MSc and BSc in Physics at the <a href='https://www.aub.edu.lb/'>American University of Beirut</a>. My research sits at the intersection of multi-agent LLM systems and cognitive science. I study emergent dynamics of AI collectives to design adaptable systems that can enhance human creativity. My work is driven by the vision of hybrid Human-AI societies, where AI agents interact with and augment human organizations. 

Guided by my interest in collective intelligence, I co-founded <a href='https://fatima.institute/'>Fatima Fellowship</a>, an international, human-centered initiative aims to democratize access to AI research for young researchers in developing countries. My broader commitment to technology for development includes previous research at the <a href='https://archive.unescwa.org/our-work/technology-development'>Technology for Development Division</a> at United Nations Economic & Social Commission for Western Asia and the <a href='https://www.aub.edu.lb/ifi/Pages/Sustainability-Inclusive-Development.aspx'>Sustainability and Inclusive Development Cluster</a> at Issam Fares Institute for Public Policy and International Affairs.
